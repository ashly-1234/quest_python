1. What is the alternative implementation of function overloading in Python?
	Python doesn't support traditional function overloading where multiple functions share the same name but have different parameter types. However, here are a few common ways to achieve similar functionality:
	1. Default Arguments:
		Set default values for parameters, allowing the function to work with different argument combinations.
		eg:-    def greet(name, greeting="Hello"):
					print(greeting, name)

				greet("Alice")  # Outputs: Hello Alice
				greet("Bob", "Hi")  # Outputs: Hi Bob
				
	2. Variable-Length Arguments:
		Use *args and **kwargs to accept any number of positional or keyword arguments.
		eg:-	   def add(*numbers):
						return sum(numbers)

					add(1, 2)  # Outputs: 3
					add(1, 2, 3, 4)  # Outputs: 10
					
	3. Type Checking within the Function:
		Use isinstance() or similar functions to check the types of arguments and execute different code paths accordingly.
		eg:-		   def calculate(x, y):
							if isinstance(x, int) and isinstance(y, int):
								return x + y
						elif isinstance(x, float) and isinstance(y, float):
								return x * y
						else:
								return "Invalid input types"

						calculate(2, 3)  # Outputs: 5
						calculate(2.5, 3.5)  # Outputs: 8.75
						
	4. Multiple Dispatch Library:
		Use the multipledispatch library to define functions with different implementations based on argument types.
		eg:- 	   from multipledispatch import dispatch

				    @dispatch(int, int)
				    def add(x, y):
						return x + y

					@dispatch(float, float)
					def add(x, y):
						return x * y

					add(2, 3)  # Outputs: 5
					add(2.5, 3.5)  # Outputs: 8.75
    The best approach depends on the specific use case and the level of flexibility needed. 
	Default arguments and variable-length arguments are often sufficient for simple scenarios. 
	Type checking and the multipledispatch library provide more robust solutions for complex situations where 
	type-based behavior is essential.
	
	
2. Why there is no implicit type casting in Python ?
		Python does have implicit type casting, but in a limited way compared to some other languages. It's important to 
		distinguish between implicit type conversion and implicit type casting:
	Implicit type conversion:
		Python automatically converts between certain types when it makes sense and doesn't lead to data loss. 
		For example, it converts an integer to a float when adding them together.
	Implicit type casting:
	This generally refers to converting between incompatible types without explicit instruction from the programmer. 
	Python avoids this to prevent unexpected behavior and errors.
	Here's why Python doesn't do widespread implicit type casting:
	Strong Typing:
		Python is a strongly typed language, meaning it enforces data types and doesn't allow operations between incompatible types 
		without explicit conversion. This helps catch errors early on.
	Explicit is better than Implicit:
		Python's philosophy emphasizes readability and clarity, and explicit type conversions make code more understandable.
	Avoiding Ambiguity:
		Implicit type casting can lead to unexpected results, especially when dealing with complex data types. 
		Python avoids this by requiring explicit conversions.
	However, Python does perform implicit type conversions in certain cases:
	Numeric types:
		When performing arithmetic operations between integers and floats, Python automatically converts the integer to a float.
	Widening conversions:
		When assigning a value of a smaller type to a variable of a larger type, Python automatically converts the value. 
		For example, assigning an integer to a float variable.
	In conclusion, while Python does have some implicit type conversions, it avoids widespread implicit type casting to maintain 
	strong typing, clarity, and avoid ambiguity.
	
3. Why there is no ++ and -- (increment/decrement) operators in Python?
	Python doesn't have the ++ and -- operators for a few reasons:
	Simplicity and Readability:
		Python prioritizes code readability and simplicity. The ++ and -- operators can be confusing, especially for beginners, 
		due to their prefix and postfix variations. Python instead uses x += 1 and x -= 1, which are more explicit and easier to
		understand.
	Immutable Integers:
		In Python, integers are immutable, meaning they can't be changed in place. When you increment an integer using x += 1, 
		you're actually creating a new integer object and assigning it to x. The ++ operator would imply modifying the integer in place,
		which doesn't align with Python's object model.
	Consistency:
		Python strives for consistency in its language design. Using the += and -= operators for incrementing and decrementing
		is consistent with the way you perform other arithmetic operations like x *= 2 or x /= 3.

4. What is the difference between @static method and @class method?
	In Python, @staticmethod and @classmethod are decorators that can be used to define methods within a class that are not 
	standard instance methods. Although they might seem similar, they serve different purposes and have distinct behaviors.

	@staticmethod
		Definition: A static method is a method that does not receive any special first argument (like self or cls).
		Usage: It behaves like a plain function but belongs to the class's namespace. Static methods do not operate on an instance 
		of the class or the class itself.
		When to Use: Use static methods for utility functions that perform a task in isolation, without needing access to class 
		or instance-specific data.


	@classmethod
		Definition: A class method is a method that receives the class itself as the first argument, conventionally named cls.
		Usage: It can access and modify class state that applies across all instances of the class. Class methods can be called
		on the class itself, not requiring an instance to be created.
		When to Use: Use class methods for factory methods that create instances of the class, or when you need to operate
		on the class as a whole.
		
		Example:


	class MyClass:
		count = 0
    
		def __init__(self):
			MyClass.count += 1

		@classmethod
		def get_instance_count(cls):
			return cls.count

	# Usage
	instance1 = MyClass()
	instance2 = MyClass()
	print(MyClass.get_instance_count()) 

	Key Differences
	First Argument:
	
		Static Method: Does not take any special first argument.
		Class Method: Takes the class itself as the first argument (cls).
	Access:

		Static Method: Cannot access or modify the class state or instance state.
		Class Method: Can access and modify the class state.
	Usage Context:

		Static Method: Utility functions that are logically related to the class but do not need class or instance data.
		Class Method: Factory methods or methods that need to operate on the class itself.
		
5. What is the difference between __new__() and __init__() ?
		In Python, __new__() and __init__() are two special methods associated with object creation and initialization. 
		They serve distinct purposes and are called at different stages of an object's lifecycle.

	__new__() Method
		Purpose: __new__() is responsible for creating a new instance of a class. It is the method that constructs the object in memory.
		Usage: It is a static method (though usually defined as a class method) that takes the class itself as its first argument. 
		It returns a new instance of the class.
		When to Use: Use __new__() when you need to control the creation of a new instance, particularly when subclassing immutable types like tuples or strings.
		Example:


		class MyClass:
			def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
				print("Creating instance")
				instance = super(MyClass, cls).__new__(cls)
				return instance

			def __init__(self, value):
				print("Initializing instance")
				self.value = value

		# Usage
		obj = MyClass(10)
		# Output:
		# Creating instance
		# Initializing instance
		
	__init__() Method
		Purpose: __init__() is responsible for initializing a newly created instance. It sets up the initial state of the object.
		Usage: It takes the newly created instance as its first argument (usually named self) and initializes it with any additional arguments passed to the constructor.
		When to Use: Use __init__() for instance-specific initialization, such as setting initial values for instance variables.
		Example:


		class MyClass:
			def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
				print("Creating instance")
				instance = super(MyClass, cls).__new__(cls)
				return instance

			def __init__(self, value):
				print("Initializing instance")
				self.value = value

		# Usage
		obj = MyClass(10)
		# Output:
		# Creating instance
		# Initializing instance
	Key Differences
	Stage in Lifecycle:

		__new__(): Called first to create the instance. It is responsible for returning a new instance of the class.
		__init__(): Called after __new__() to initialize the instance. It does not return the instance (implicitly returns None).
	Return Value:

		__new__(): Must return a new instance of the class (or an instance of a different class).
		__init__(): Does not return anything. It initializes the instance created by __new__().
	Usage Context:

		__new__(): Used for controlling the creation of new instances, particularly for immutable types.
		__init__(): Used for initializing instances after they have been created.

6. What is the syntax to use switch-case in Python. Given an example.
	Python does not have a built-in switch-case statement like some other programming languages (e.g., C, Java). 
	However, you can achieve similar functionality using dictionaries to map cases to their corresponding actions or by using
	if-elif-else statements. Since Python 3.10, the match statement (also known as structural pattern matching) provides a 
	more direct way to implement switch-case-like behavior.

	Using Dictionaries
		A common way to mimic switch-case functionality in earlier versions of Python is to use dictionaries to map keys to functions or values.

		Example:


		def case_one():
			return "This is case one"

		def case_two():
			return "This is case two"

		def case_default():
			return "This is the default case"

		def switch_case(value):
			switch = {
				1: case_one,
				2: case_two,
			}
			return switch.get(value, case_default)()

		value = 1
		print(switch_case(value))  # Output: This is case one

		value = 3
		print(switch_case(value))  # Output: This is the default case
		
	Using if-elif-else Statements:
		Another way to handle multiple cases is using if-elif-else statements.

		Example:

		def switch_case(value):
			if value == 1:
				return "This is case one"
			elif value == 2:
				return "This is case two"
			else:
				return "This is the default case"

		value = 1
		print(switch_case(value))  # Output: This is case one

		value = 3
		print(switch_case(value))  # Output: This is the default case
		
	Using match Statement (Python 3.10+):
		The match statement introduced in Python 3.10 provides a more intuitive and flexible way to implement switch-case-like logic.

		Example:

		def switch_case(value):
			match value:
				case 1:
					return "This is case one"
				case 2:
					return "This is case two"
				case _:
					return "This is the default case"

		value = 1
		print(switch_case(value))  # Output: This is case one

		value = 3
		print(switch_case(value))  # Output: This is the defaul
		
7. Can the key within a dictionary be a composite value like a list or tuple, or should it be an atomic value such as number or string?
	In Python, tuples can be used as dictionary keys to create composite keys. Tuples are hashable and immutable, unlike lists, 
	which are mutable and can't be used as dictionary keys. Dictionary keys must be immutable data types, like characters, numbers, 
	or tuples. 
	Here's why tuples are preferred for composite keys:
		Immutability: Tuples are immutable, making them suitable for dictionary keys.
		Hashability: Tuples are hashable, unlike lists, which makes them useful for creating composite keys. 
	While strings and tuples work well as keys, other types might not work properly. Dictionaries can't have duplicate keys, 
	and neither lists nor other dictionaries can be used as keys because they are mutable. 
	Dictionary values can be almost any type, including integers, lists, functions, or strings
