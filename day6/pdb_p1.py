# PDB (Python Debugger)
 
# python -m pdb <name>.py[args] 		(begin the debugger)
 
# help[command] view a list of commands, or view help for a specific
# command
 
# within a python file:
# import pdb
# ...
# pdb.set_trace() 
# Add the above call to begin the debugger at this line when the file is run normally.
 
# NAVIGATING CODE: (within the Pdb interpreter)
# l(ist) 		list 11 lines surrounding the current line
# w(here) 	display the file and line number of the current line
# n(ext) 		execute the current line
# s(tep) 		step into function called at the current line
# r(eturn) 	execute until the current functionâ€™s return is
# encountered
 
# CONTROLLING EXECUTION:
# b[#] 		create a breakpoint at line [#]
# b 			list breakpoints and their indices
# c(ontinue)	execute until a breakpoint is encountered
# clear[#] 	clear breakpoint of index [#]
 
# CHANGING VARIABLES / INTERACTING WITH CODE:
# p<name> 	print value of the variable <name>
# !<expr> 	execute the expression <expr>
# NOTE: this acts just like a python interpreter
# run[args] 	restart the debugger with sys.argv arguments [args]
# q(uit) exit the debugger
